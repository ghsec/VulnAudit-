# Buffer Overflow
Users have to know that detecting a buffer overflow vulnerability will be only possible if the server is configured to return errors, and the application is developed in cgi-c or some other language that allows the programmer to do their own memory management.

#TODO: if lengths = ```[ 65 , 257 , 513 , 1025, 2049, 4097, 8000 ]``` then I get a BadStatusLine exception from urllib2, is seems to be an internal error. Tested against tomcat 5.5.7

### Payload
Build Payloads
Example: ```['A' * payload_len for payload_len in [65, 257, 513, 1025, 2049]]```

        </head><body>
        <h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
```        
### Some notes:
On Apache, when an overflow happends on a cgic script, this is written to the log
```
                       *** stack smashing detected ***

                /var/www/.../buffer_overflow.cgi terminated,
                referer: http://localhost/w3af/buffer_overflow.cgi
 
                Premature end of script headers: buffer_overflow.cgi,
                referer: ...
    
On Apache, when an overflow happens on a cgic script, this is returned to the user:
